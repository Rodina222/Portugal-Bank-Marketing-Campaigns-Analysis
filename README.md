# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the results of marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank. These campaigns primarily involved direct phone calls to clients, with the aim of offering term deposits. The project explores the dataset and builds a predictive model to assist in formulating future marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about various marketing efforts and their outcomes. It includes both client data (e.g., age, job type, marital status) and campaign-specific attributes (e.g., contact method, campaign duration, and previous interactions).

## Dashboard
Below is a preview of the interactive dashboard created for this project:
